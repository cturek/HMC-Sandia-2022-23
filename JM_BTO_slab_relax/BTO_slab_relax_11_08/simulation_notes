simulation ran for 55 iterations over 5 hours but did not converge
got all the usual output files excpet for lcao.out
lcao.hist file only contained 10 iterations even though it ran for 55?

3x3 slab with H interacting on end
center barium fixed

changes for next version of simulation: 
adjust H to hopefully already be in line with the row of O (where we expect it to bind)
freeze multiple atoms (hopefully the ones on the opposite side as the H)
increase number of possible iterations from 55 to 100
