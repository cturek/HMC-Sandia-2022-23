 This set of files and directories:
Inputs to run an H2 molecule optimization.  
The initial H2 coordinates were taken from the phosphonic acid molecule (run elsewhere). 
I deleted everything but 2 H atoms, and then let it optimize to find and H2 molecule. 
The top directory contains .jmol file, which you can use to watch the optimization steps.  
The file "files-list" is a list of all the output files that were generated.
I deleted all the larger binary and various grid files because they are quite large, and we do not need them for this demo. 
The "inputs" directory containes only the original input files, which you can run to duplicate the original results.
This full optimization took about 10 minutes to run on my workstation. It starts a bit far from the minimum.
The "inputs-optimized" directory contains a new input file with the optimized H2 coordinates.
Running this took about 30 seconds, for an energy and one force calculation (which was identified as converged, and the calculation exited). 
I would use this input to run tests of your own on, such as changing offsets, coordinates, .atm files, and so on. 


You will notice that one of the H atoms is fixed, which makes the optimization easier.  
Some of the input parameters, such as the placement of the atoms in space, the scaling factors, and the displacement vector, were taken from a slab+molecule simulation I ran earlier. 
Doing this can be convenient for placing moelcule or atoms on a surface later.To look at a molecule, feel free to change any of this about.
When we get to placing items on a slab, these parameters will be changed to match whatever slab we ar choosing to work with.
