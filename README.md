# HMC-Sandia-2022-23
Code for Sandia Clinic

This repository contains code used by the 2022/23 Sandia Clinic Team at Harvey Mudd College. 

When possible, try to not commit binary files generated by SeqQuest. These files can be quite large (on the order of hundreds of megabytes); they slow down computation and make the file structure messier. Please only push input, output, and atom files to the repository.

SeqQuest files have been provided by the US Air Force via our liaison, Renee Van Ginhoven.
